        I'm an experienced software engineer with experience in various game development technologies and have created standalone applications in various mobile and web development frameworks.
        I've found excuses to make video games as a hobby throughout my college and now post college career, and more recently have begun contributing to in-house military applications as part of my Reserve Marine Corps Career.
        I crave impact and meaningful work, so please browse my favorite projects and experiences below, and let me know if you want to work together!
